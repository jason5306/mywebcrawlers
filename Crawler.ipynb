      "Sleep apnea (SA) is the most common respiratory sleep disorder, leading to some serious neurological and cardiovascular diseases if left untreated. The diagnosis of SA is traditionally made using Polysomnography (PSG). However, this method requires many electrodes and wires, as well as an expert to monitor the test. Several researchers have proposed instead using a single channel signal for SA\n",

      "It is difficult to apply traditional testing adequacy criteria when measuring the adequacy of convolutional neural network applications. However, only a small number of test cases applied to the CNN model can achieve neuron coverage of almost 100%, overturning the effectiveness of the neuronal coverage criteria. In this paper, we propose a model coverage criterion based on mutation testing for\n",
